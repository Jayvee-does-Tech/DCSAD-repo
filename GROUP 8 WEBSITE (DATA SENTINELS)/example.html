                    <h1>DATA BREACH AND CYBER SECURITY</h1>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p> Data breaches are intentional or inadvertent exposures of confidential information to unauthorized parties, posing serious threats to organizations 
                        and individuals worldwide. Since the first cyber attack in 1988, numerous attacks have been created, attempting to steal and destroy data from other 
                        computer systems. Cybersecurity measures have become more complex and advanced, with notable instances including Sony's PlayStation Network data breach 
                        in 2011, Target in 2013, and Microsoft and Facebook in 2021. Trend Micro defines a data breach as an incident involving stolen data from unaware users 
                        and system owners. To combat this threat, various security measures have been implemented, such as two-factor authentication, fingerprint detection, and OTPs.
                        Anti-virus systems have also been improved to prevent data loss from cyber attacks. This paper discusses data breaches and their effects, and how cybersecurity
                        works to circumvent these attacks from users worldwide.

                    <h2>Main</h2>
                    <p>Data Breaches and Cyber Security go hand in hand or in other words they are both closely connected in the world of information technology and digital security. Data breaches are incidents that highlight vulnerabilities in an organizationâ€™s integrity in which Cyber Security comes in. Cyber security measures multiple lines of defense that prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from possible data breaches, ultimately ensuring the protection of large companies, individuals, governments, and states sensitive data.
    
                        How does Data Breach happen?
                        Everyone is vulnerable to data breaches, not only megacorporations housing millions of data under their servers but also everyday users like us can be victims to this type of cyber attack. For instance, this attack can be triggered when you connect on a public wifi at a coffee shop or at an airport and not use VPNs or Virtual Private Networks. How this happens is the hacker gets your IP address and then proceeds to hack your machine. Data breaches can also happen when someone who is anonymous sends a link or file to you and when you open that link or file, a virus will work its way onto your machine and get your information. If your device has been breached, the hacker can browse through your information freely without getting caught and they may have access to your personal data, credit card info, bank accounts, and other similar sensitive data.
                        
                        How can data breaches be prevented?
                        There are a number of ways you can protect yourself from data breaches, and that number only goes up as technology advances over time. Here are some preventive measures that every user can do to protect their personal data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Change your passwords regularly</li>
                            <li>Use two-factor authentication</li>
                            <li>Update your system software</li>
                            <li>Monitor your accounts</li>
                        </ul>

                <section class="panel_E">
                    <h2>Examples</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Hacking
                            <p>Skilled hackers use various techniques to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, allowing them to steal sensitive data. This can include exploiting software vulnerabilities, brute force attacks, and using stolen credentials.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Phishing</li>
                            <p>Phishing attacks often lead to data breaches when individuals are tricked into revealing their login credentials, which attackers can then use to access systems and data.</p>
                        <li>Malware</li>
                            <p>Malicious software, such as keyloggers, spyware, or Trojans, can be used to steal data directly from infected systems, leading to data breaches.</p>
                        <li>Insider Threats</li>
                            <p>Employees or insiders with access to sensitive data may intentionally or accidentally expose that data through actions like data theft, sharing confidential information, or falling victim to social engineering attacks</p>
                        <li>Third-Party Breaches</li>
                            <p>When a third-party vendor or partner experiences a data breach, it can potentially expose data of the organizations that use their services or share data with them.</p>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>As digital technology increasingly evolves, so does the risk of cybercrime as a result of hackers who prey on the system's data storage, raising serious concerns for users, organizations, and society across the globe. 
                        Cybercrime, such as data breaches, has been a major concern for society since they disclose private information to unauthorized users online. Another danger it poses is that it has numerous methods to infiltrate a user's 
                        account or the system. This requires organizations and governments to adapt to the change and improve cybersecurity measures to ensure that they can protect our data privacy and battle emerging security threats. As users, 
                        it is also our duty to protect both our personal information and ourselves online. Only by accepting change and keeping vigilant will we be able to survive in this evolving digital world.
